# SP108E-control
Allows desktop control of the "LED Shop SP108E" LED driver/controller

Prototyped using Wireshark and PacketSender via a Windows 10 WiFi hotspot.

-- NOTE: It is very easy to softlock your SP108E if you send it data it does not expect, and very difficult to fix it. Stick to known messages and valid data.
